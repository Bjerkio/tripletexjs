A wrapper for Tripletex 2.0 API in Typescript / Javascript.

## This is automatically built with Swagger Codegen!
We know there is better ways of doing this. Please read more under the contribute section. We need you!

## How?
```nodejs
var tripletexjs = require('tripletexjs');
```

If you use Typescript, the package comes with both definitions and typescript files.

## Contribute!
We welcome better ways to implement these functions. Some of the things
we really would like is to build better documentation and accommodate for
Tripletex 2.0 API's authentication.
