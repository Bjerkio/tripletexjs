A wrapper for Tripletex JSON-RPC API.


## Not completed!
As of now, not complete, but it includes;

 * Sync Service
 * Company Service
 * Product Service
 * Project Service, not complete!
 * Invoice Service, not complete!


## Contribute!
If you are developing for this awful API, please contribute to making this
as good as it can get. There is yet to be developed how you can add invoice(s)
and add order(s).

Many of the missing services just needs simple copy-paste work.
